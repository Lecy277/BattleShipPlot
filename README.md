# C-Plus-PLus-BattleShip

This program creates a series of .dat files for gnuplot in 3D that represent various positions of a battle group in formation and during refueling. The ships in the battle group are represented by various colored squares. Once the program has run and all the .dat files have been created gnuplot displays the 3D grid by creating PNG files based on the plot positions in the .dat files.

Below are the series of PNG plots created by gnuplot.
